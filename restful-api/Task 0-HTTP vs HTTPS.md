üåê HTTP and HTTPS Overview
What is HTTP?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the standard system that allows web browsers and servers to communicate. It works over a TCP connection and is stateless, meaning each request is independent and doesn‚Äôt require a continuous connection.

HTTP is an application layer protocol, focusing on transferring readable data between clients and servers. However, it lacks security ‚Äî data is sent as plain text, making it vulnerable to interception or modification (known as a Man-in-the-Middle Attack).

HTTP vs HTTPS

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data and authenticate the server‚Äôs identity. This prevents hackers from accessing or tampering with information sent between a user and a website.

SSL certificates, issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs), verify that the website truly owns its domain and establish trust using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ‚Äî the standard for secure communication online.

How HTTPS Works

When a site uses HTTPS, all data (like passwords or credit card info) is encrypted before being sent. Web browsers show a padlock icon in the address bar to indicate a secure connection. Without HTTPS, data is sent in plain text and can easily be intercepted.

Does HTTPS Mean a Website Is Safe?

HTTPS ensures that:

The server‚Äôs identity is verified.

Data between user and server is encrypted.

However, it does not guarantee the website itself is free from malware or unsafe content. It‚Äôs a key security measure but only one part of overall web safety.

Speed Comparison

HTTP is slightly faster since it doesn‚Äôt encrypt data or verify identities.
HTTPS is marginally slower due to the SSL handshake, but this delay is so small that it‚Äôs barely noticeable with modern systems.

HTTPS Today

HTTPS is now standard across the web. Major browsers and platforms require it to protect users‚Äô data by default. Developers widely adopt HTTPS to ensure security, trust, and compliance with modern web standards.
